The fastest (and easiest) way to install a Palcs-UI Canvancement flavor is to click on the filename from the description below. If you click on the filename from the list at the top, you can view the code, but then you will need to click the Raw button to install it.

## Default Installation
[palcs-ui.user.js](https://github.com/dslusser/PalcsUI-Canvancement/raw/master/install/palcs-ui.user.js) is currently the only type of configuration and is considered the "Default" installation. In the future, additional configurations will be added to accomodate other types of enhancements. In this default configuration, all types of enhancements are enabled. If the user desires, they have the ability to disable any specific options in the configuration. The user simply changes the option type from "true" to "false" in order to turn off a configuration option.

This installation script may change if new features are added to the Palcs-UI Canvancements. Since the user scripts automatically update your scripts, your configuration may be lost. For most people, it is best to just to start with this default script, change settings as desired, and then watch for announcements of new features.
