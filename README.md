# PalcsUI Canvancement
The PalcsUI Canvancement is a user script developed by Dan Slusser. It was inspired by the [Canvancements](https://github.com/jamesjonesmath/canvancement) project that was developed by James Jonesâ€‹ and Avi Naiman. This script adds various enhancements to the Palcs Canvas instance that increases productivity and the overall user experience. It runs in SpeedGrader and on the quiz moderation pages.

## Quick Install
1. Install and enable the [Tampermonkey](http://tampermonkey.net/) browser extension
2. Choose one of the [PalcsUI Canvancement Installation Scripts](install)

For most people, those two steps are all that should be needed. If you wish to change the settings or your Canvas instance uses a custom domain, then you will need to edit the user script.

## Features
The PalcsUI Canvancement adds two major types of improvements to Canvas: *user interface enhancements*, which improve the user's tools and workflow; and *user experience enhancements*, which improve the overall Canvas experience, including minor "look and feel" adjustments to certain Canvas elements.

The PalcsUI Canvancement project was developed by Dan Slusser. Without the framework of the original Canvancements project, the PalcsUI Canvancements would not be possible. Thank you to James Jones and Avi Naiman for their initial work that allowed me to develop the PalcsUI Canvancements.
